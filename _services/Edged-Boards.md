Edged lumber is usually dried in the oven (killed dry) and reaches a humidity of 8-12%, making the wood more durable and less sensitive to deformities. In contrast to unedged wood, the edged wood comes in predefined dimensions and can be inserted directly into the production chain, without prior procedures. Edged lumber can also be suitable for the production of luxury and more classical furniture. The edged timber is used in the production of side doors, chests, chairs and more. Since the production process of edged wood is longer, it is considered more expensive and rare than the unedged one.

There are various species of trees that can be obtained in their edged and unedged form. Among them is the European oak wood. For most manufacturers, they prefer the oak tree when trimmed, and can be directly put into the production process, because it saves time and additional costs, which can lead to improved revenue. However, there are few manufacturers who are interested in purchasing an unedged oak lumber or unedged beech lumber because of the relatively reasonable cost of sawing and the wide application. Therefore it is important for a variety of wood suppliers to assess the nature of the market and the level of demand for a variety of different types of woods in order to make the best use of their production.
